Oops concepts in Selenium Automation:

#1. ABSTRACTION
Abstraction is the methodology of hiding the implementation of internal details and showing the functionality to the users.
In Page Object Model design pattern, we write locators (such as id, name, xpath etc.,) and the methods in a Page Class. We utilize these locators in tests but we can’t see the implementation of the methods. Literally we hide the implementations of the locators from the tests.
#2. INTERFACE
Basic statement we all know in Selenium is WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
WebDriver itself is an Interface. So based on the above statement WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); we are initializing Firefox browser using Selenium WebDriver
We can achieve 100% abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java with Interface.
#3. INHERITANCE
The mechanism in Java by which one class acquires the properties (instance variables) and functionalities of another class is known as Inheritance.
We create a Base Class in the Automation Framework to initialize WebDriver interface, WebDriver waits, Property files, Excels, etc., in the Base Class.
We extend the Base Class in other classes such as Tests and Utility Class.
#4. POLYMORPHISM
Polymorphism allows us to perform a task in multiple ways.
#1. METHOD OVERLOADING
We use Implicit wait in Selenium. Implicit wait is an example of overloading. In Implicit wait we use different time stamps such as SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS etc.,rttdsz
Action class in TestNG is also an example of overloading.
Assert class in TestNG is also an example of overloading.
#2. METHOD OVERRIDING
We use a method which was already implemented in another class by changing its parameters. To understand this you need to understand Overriding in Java.
Declaring a method in child class which is already present in the parent class is called Method Overriding. Examples are get and navigate methods of different drivers in Selenium .

one more example of overriding :
In class XLutils , we extend TestListnerAdapter class to implement its method OnTestStart,OnTestSkip,OnTestFailure etc.


Selenium limitations. 
1. Selenium does not support automation testing for desktop applications.
2. Does not provide any test management tool
3. Lacks built-in reporting feature
4. Supports only a single browser
6. Unable testing of Image-based web applications
7. Inability to test mobile apps directly
8. We can't perform automation tests on web services like SOAP or REST using Selenium
9. Creating test environment in Selenium takes more time as compared to vendor tools like UFT, RFT, Silk test, etc.
10. Unable to handle dynamic elements
11. It does not have built-in Object Repository like UTF/QTP to maintain objects/elements in centralized location.
12. You cannot create cross-platform end-to-end tests with WebDriver.

//about testNG listener
test inside classes are going to fire the events and 
these events will be listened by the methods in the
listeners class and when these methods get invoked we
write some code in those methods to perform such kind 
of actions when such kind of events occur
